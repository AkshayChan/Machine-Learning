    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "In this assignment our goal is to recognize objects in images of realistic scenes. There are 19 different classes of object e.g. person, dog, cat, car, etc. The dataset derives from several thousands photographs harvested from the web. Each object of a relevant class has been manually annotated with a bounding box. Images can contain none, one or multiple objects of each class. We have prepared a [website](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/iaml/2014/assts/asst3/images.html) where you can view the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to detect whether images contain a person or not - a binary classification problem. To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we have preprocessed the dataset. We will use the [Bag of Visual Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model_in_computer_vision) representation. Each column of the dataset (which is not an lable), refers to a 'visual word'. Each image is represented by a 500 dimensional vector that contains the normalized count for each of 500 different visual words present in the respective image (a similar representation is used for the spambase dataset, just for real words). See the Appendix at the bottom of the notebook for more information. The image data is thus a $N \\times 500$ dimensional matrix where `N` is the number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset has 520 attributes (dimensions). The first attribute (`imgID`) contains the image ID which allows you to associate a data point with an actual image. The next 500 attributes (`dim1`, ..., `dim500`) are a normalized count vector for each visual word. The last 19 attributes (`is_class`) are the labels - 1 means the class is present in the image. In most of the experiments (unless explicitly noted otherwise) you will only need the `is_person` attribute and the 500 dimensional feature vector. **Do not use the additional class indicator attributes as features** unless explicitly told to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part A we provide you with a training (`train_images partA.csv`) and a validation (`valid_images partA .csv`) dataset. In Part B we provide three data sets: a training set (`train_images partB.csv`), a validation set (`valid_images partB.csv`), and a test set (`test_images partB.csv`). The training and validation set contain valid labels. In the test set the labels are missing. The files are available from the GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: *Throughout the assignment you will be given various versions of the dataset that are relevant\n",
    "to a particular question. Please be careful to use the correct version of the dataset when instructed to do so.\n",
    "If you use the wrong version of the dataset by mistake no marks will be awarded.*"

You can specify the range for the `C` parameter, as well as the cross-validation method you want to use with the `Cs` and `cv` parameters, respectively. Use the `C` range you set up in Question 1.12 and the 3-fold cross-validation iterator from Question 1.11. Once again, train the models by using the `lbfgs` optimisation method and display the optimal value for the parameter `C`. Finally, display the classification accuracy on the validation set.

The rbf does decently well because of the basis functions that give its shape with the the two peaks and the trough. It seems to do better than the polynomial giving a non linear decision boundary as a lot of the points near the peak of the polynomial seem incorrectly classified.  "

    "Now we turn to the kernel coefficient `gamma` parameter. By using the same procedure as in the previous question, estimate the classification accuracy of an SVM classifier with RBF kernel while you vary the `gamma` parameter in a logarithmic range `logspace(-5, 0, 10)`. Fix the penalty parameter `C=1.0`.\n",

This could be possibly because the optimal value of C lies in a smaller range as seen in question 1.21, where the classification accuracy starts attaining very high rates for C values between 0.1 and 10. Similarly, the accuracy is very high for gamma in the range 0.001 to 0.01 as seen in 1.22. This is proven by the fact that the best classifier performance we get in this case is for C=1.0 and gamma=0.1 which both fall in the ranges specified \n",

    "You might have noticted that so far, we have used cross-validation for optimising the various tuning parameters (e.g. regularisation parameter in logistic regression, SVM kernel parameters) rather than hold-out validation, although we did have access to a validation set. Why do you think this is a good/bad idea? Give one advantage and one disadvantage of the two different approaches. Which one would you trust more in practice?"

    "It is a good idea because cross validation helps us make sure our model is generally performing well on average and adapts to the entire training data before we use it to classify any unseen data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of cross validation is that we don't have to worry about the uneven splitting of data as every point is in the testing set exactly once. One disadvantage is that it splits the data k times and hence the computation is very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of hold out validation is that we get an estimate of how our classifier will perform on unseen data before we use it on the seperate validation set. A disadvantage is possibly high variance as the evaluation may depend heavily on which points end up in the training set and which points end up in the testing set.\n",

Remove the `imgId` attribute but keep all of the class indicator variables in the dataset this time. Your training features should include all attributes except `is_person` which should be your target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, use a [StandardScaler](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) to standardise your training and validation features. Then train a Random Forest Classifier by using the entropy `criterion`, 500 `n_estimators`, and also set the `random_state` to 31. Report the classification accuracy on the training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to what we did in Question 1.18, order the features by decreasing importance and display the 50 most important features. \n",

    "* What do you notice by looking at the list of the best 50 features?\n",

You should familiarise yourself with the metric by reading the `sklearn` [user guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#log-loss) and [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html#sklearn.metrics.log_loss). To estimate this metric you will need to evaluate probability outputs, as opposed to discrete predictions which we have used so far to compute classification accuracies. Most models in `sklearn` implement a `predict_proba()` method which returns the probabilities for each class. For instance, if your test set consists of `N` datapoints and there are `K` classes, the method will return a `N` x `K` matrix."

    "Visual words are based on [Scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform). SIFT features are essentially local orientation histograms and capture the properties of small image regions. They possess attractive invariance properties which make them well suited for our task (you can read more about SIFT features in [D.Lowe, IJCV 60(2):91- 110, 2004](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94), but the details don't matter for the purpose of this assignment). Each SIFT feature is a 128 dimensional vector. From each image many SIFT features are extracted, typically > 2500 per image (features are extracted at regular intervals using a 15 pixel grid and at 4 different scales). To obtain visual words a representative subset of all extracted SIFT features from all images is chosen and clustered with k-means using 500 centres (such use of the k-means algorithm will be discussed in detail during the lecture). These 500 cluster centres form our visual words. The representation of a single image is obtained by first assigning each SIFT feature extracted from the image to the appropriate cluster (i.e. we determine the visual word corresponding to each feature by picking the closest cluster centre). We then count the number of features from that image assigned to each cluster (i.e. we determine how often each visual word is present in the image). This results in a 500 dimensional count vector for each image (one dimension for each visual word). The normalized version of this count vector gives the final representation of the image (normalized means that we divide the count vector by the total number of visual words in the image, i.e. the normalized counts sum to 1 for each image)"
